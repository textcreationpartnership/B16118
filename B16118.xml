            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the impertiall and vvellmeaninge READER.</head>
            <p>FOr as much as impertial Reader, it is not vnknowne vnto us that the Lord Christ geve vnto &amp; left with his Apostells a Comanndemente and ordinance to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served which is Baptisme to those that beleeve, as apeareth Math. 28. VVhere he sayth. Goe and teache al nations Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe them in the name of the Father te Sonne and the Holie Ghost, teachinge them to observe all thinges what soever I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve comannded you. And Marke, 16. Goe yee into all the world and preach the Gospel to everie Creature, he that shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be beleeve and be baptised shalbe saved. The which Comann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement they obsērved vsed and taught as apeareth Act. 2. 8 9. 10, 16. 19. 22. Rom. 6. Gal. 3. And was by the Anncient Fathers in the primative Church for a time vnviolablye kept and vsed, as the wrytinges of divers both of the Anncyent &amp; latter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers aleaged in this treatise do manifestlie schowe.</p>
            <p>VVe will therefore first shewe by testimonies out of holie Scripture that Christ comannded his Apostells and Servantes of the holie Ghost first of all to preache the Gospell and make Discyples, and then afterwardes to Baptise those that weare instructed in the fayth in Callinge vpon and Confessinge the name of God. The which we will illustrate and Confirme by the wittnes of the Anncyent and latter teachers.</p>
            <p>Secondlie shalbe proved out of holie Scripture that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entlie shewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that after the Apostells time by the primative Church &amp; Anncyent Fathers who observed &amp; followed the ordinance of Christ and Example of the Apostells, the people weare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie first instructed in the Misteries of fayth, and after that they weare taught they weare Baptised vpon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thlye it is proved that in the primative Church the Children both of the faythfull &amp; others weare comonlye first instructed in the fayth and afterwardes vpon acknowledginge and Confession of the same they weare Baptised.</p>
            <p>Fiftlie it is in briefe demonstrated by testimonies out of the holie Scripture that accordinge to the institution of the Lorde Christ and the Apostells and Anncyent Fathers right vse. The teachers required fayth with baptisme and that he that was baptised must himselfe acknowledge and Confesse the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and call vpon the name of the Lorde with both the Ann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent and latter wryters approbation &amp; Confirmation of the saide testimonie.</p>
            <p>Sixtlie it is proved out of their owne wrytinges, whith vse Childrens baptisme, that Christ neyther gave Comannde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for baptisme of younge Children, nor instituted the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and that the Apostells never baptised any infantes.</p>
            <p>Seventlye it is proved out of the wrytinges both of the Anncyent and latter teachers that the baptisme of infantes is an ordinance of man &amp; à selfe received opinion, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by teachers after the Apostells and instituted and comannded by Counsells Popes and Emperors.</p>
